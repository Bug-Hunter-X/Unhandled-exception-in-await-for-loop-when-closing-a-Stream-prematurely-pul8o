```dart
import 'dart:async';

Future<void> main() async {
  final stream = Stream.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i);

  await for (final value in stream) {
    print('Value: $value');
    if (value == 5) {
      //This is the problematic line. Closing the stream here will result in the exception.
      //This will throw an exception when the stream is closed because await for loops must handle potential exceptions.
      await stream.close();
    }
  }
  print('Stream closed');
}
